# tessel_api

A continuation of learning NodeJS with a Tessel 2 board. This app aims to be a simple API to access on-board leds, a stream from a usb camera, and any additional sensors connected to the device. Once deployed, the Tessel 2 will connect wirelessly to a LAN and can run on battery power. A simple UI will provide user access over the LAN to an admin panel showing real-time data from sensors and a live video stream. A simple instance of MongoDB will record connected devices and their various states.
